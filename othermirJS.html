        <div class="othermirBlurb">
            <span>Studio Othermir was more or less started after I transitioned from 2D drawing to 3D modelling then sculpting. The name was in part inspired by a number of Japanese animation houses that were called "Studio insert name here" such as Studio Pierrot (who has made a lot of money off of a blond headed ninja who likes to sneak around in orange clothes..., but that's going off topic).
            The Othermir name itself was inspired by Lord of the Rings. When The Two Towers came out, I couldn't remember or couldn't bother to remember the name of Boromir's brother, Feromir. So, obviously, the solution was to just call him Othermir. And so the name Studio Othermir was born.</span>
            <span>Of course, it's not an actual 3d studio, just more a nice way to collect the finished projects I've done in Maya and ZBrush. While both software can be used for hard surface and organic modeling, I prefer Maya in hard surface and ZBrush in organic. I feel I've gotten pretty proficient at the modeling over the years, now it's time to nail down rendering then try more dynamic scenes....assuming I don't destroy my computer in the attempt...</span>
            <span>So here are some of the things I created. Definitely a sci-fi trend in it. As I finish other things, I'll add them as well. The most recent scene I'm working on may be at the point where I can't go much further with the resources my PC has. So if that's the case, then on to a sniper rifle!</span>

                        This Twi'lek bust was my first attempt at 3D sculpting in ZBrush and probably my most overt Star Wars project at that point. Thankfully the Star Wars creative team decided that Twi'lek women don't have human like ears
                        so I got to cheat. Also taught me that I should do more research before getting into a project as the lekku (the things dangling from her head) should be longer.

                        A few months after I finished the Interceptor, my sister asked me to make her an image as a possible book cover. So of course, the image she wanted was a
                        coffee cup filled with blood and a trickle of blood running down it because, you know, vampires. While it was a favor for family, it's really my first time trying to take an image in someone else's head and make it how they want it.

                        it more with animation in mind. This animation also taught me that I really need to use a Render Farm to render it. 12 seconds took 3 weeks....
                        I also learned that if you notice something not quite right in frame 1, don't wait until frame 40 to figure out what the problem is.

                        I had wanted to use a clothing simulator and also to make a stylized, more cartoon-like, figure sculpt, so this is the result.
                        I also learned that I could make a turntable animation in ZBrush so I could show off all the angles that wouldn't be seen in a static view. I would do the same thing with the Tie Interceptor, but I would like to use my computer.
